## Why is this necessary? 
TradingView always said that they want to integrate with IBKR but it never occur. It is an issue, particularly to me as I do not want to fork out extra money for the real time market data with IBKR.

## Prerequisites

* Requires redis, Python3, and packages installed

```
pip3 install -r libs.txt

set FLASK_APP=webapp
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Painfully coded from youtube video below when i did not find the github link
